This meeting is to build awareness of the Research Software Engineer (RSE) community and to identify volunteers to help implement the practical solutions for the RSE community. If you are an academic/researcher who codes but are lacking recognition and metrics needed to progress your academic career; a professional software engineer working in the research space; or a system administrator who maintains research systems, you should think about joining.
