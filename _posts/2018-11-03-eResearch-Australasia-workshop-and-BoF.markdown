There was plenty of discussion in the RSE pre conference workshop: Recognition and Career Development for Researchers who Code. There was even more at the BoF the next day. These discussions resulted in two realisations. The first one was that while our main focus is helping researchers who code get recognised, we also need to do the same for ‘generalists’, people who bring communities together and can engage with both researchers and technical staff. The second realisation was that we are still in an embryonic phase and we need to get more people involved to get a critical mass.

This meeting, on the 5th of October at the Queensland University of Technology,
is to build awareness of the Research Software Engineer (RSE) community and to
identify volunteers to help implement the practical solutions for the RSE
community. Please consider attending if 

- you are an academic or researcher who codes but are lacking recognition and metrics needed to progress your academic career
- a professional software engineer working in the research space
- or a system administrator who maintains research systems
