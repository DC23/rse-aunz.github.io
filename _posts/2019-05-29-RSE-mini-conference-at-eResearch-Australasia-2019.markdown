At the last interim steering committee meeting on the 28th of May, there was agreement to host a RSE "Mini-conference" as an eResearch 2019 pre-conference workshop.

While the idea is to have an unconference type format to make organisation easier, we would love for people to volunteer to help. If you would like to help, please add your name and email address to the Author list in the Google Doc below:
