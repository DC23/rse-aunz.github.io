C3DIS 2019 is on from the 6th to the 10th of May. We are asking for members of the RSE community to volunteer to help us run a Hacky Hour at some point during the week and to also extend an invitation to the Friday all day RSE workshop.

Because the main percentage of C3DIS delegates are researchers,  we have decided to do a Hacky Hour earlier in the week. The idea is to promote Hacky Hours generally, connect volunteer RSEs or research support people who want to help, and to get some cross domain problems written down.

We then want to feed those cross domain problems into the Friday workshop to identify some solutions that we could convert into proposals to send to funders like the ARDC, NCI, Pawsey, and BPA. This is a great opportunity as these funders have just been provided funding and are already thinking of how they might allocate these funds.

If you are going to C3DIS and would like to help, please email me at rowland.mosbergen@unimelb.edu.au. If you would like to be a part of the RSE workshop, you can [register here.](http://www.c3dis.com/registration)
